## Basic Overview of Project

The goal of the project is to make a working web api, that will store a day's worth of events.  
The hour blocks will have different backgrounds based off the time.  
Past Events will be greyed in the task section.
Present Events will be red in the task section.
Future Events will be green in the task section.
The Save button will save any text in the task box into local memory.  
(note: must click out of the box before clicking for the save works)

## Further Development Plans

Minor Changes to color scheme.  Would be fun to break out the basic index, and use an api to build a better version, would have to change the element generation to check for month, day, year though.
